# Homework

## So why this homework?
Interacting with the DOM is a crucial part of building a website. If we cannot interact with the DOM and the javascript we write cannot be used in a browser. Connecting javascript to the browser opens up a new world of possibilities where only the imagination is the limiting factor.

## Book site
1. Open a new js file and start by declaring an array that contains 10 strings. These strings should be of book titles you have read (or made up) and be lowercase without spaces or special characters so that you can use these later as Id's. (Example: Harry Potter's - The Chamber of Secrets -> `harry_potter_chamber_secrets`). 

2. Create a basic html file called index.html and use it to load the js file, confirm the console.log show the array. (This is for debugging and making sure everything is in order. Delete it later when you're done :))

3. Make a function (or functions) that generate a `ul` with `li` elements for each book ID in the array using a for loop. 

4. Make an object containing information for each book. Each item (object) in this object should have the book ID you thought up in point 1 as a key, and it should have at least the following fields: title, language and author. 

5. Now change the function you used to display the book ID's in a list to take the actual information about the book from the object and display that. Make sure you choose the right html elements for each piece of info, for instance, a heading for the title.

6. Beautify your html page with css, add sources and alts to each of the images.
 
7. Download book covers for each book, construct a new Object which has as keys the bookId's again, and as value the path to the image source (e.g. `{"harry_potter_blabla": "./img/harry_potter_blabla.jpg", ...}`). Now loop over these entries (_hint: `Object.keys(objectName)` gives you an array containing the keys_). Then write a function which places an image at the corresponding `li` element. Remember that Objects are not ordered, so you cannot guarantee that the first key is the first `li` element. (_Hint: you could give each `li` item an `id` tag by modifying the function you made before_)

## Spirit animal name generator
Let's create a page where a user writes his name in an input element. The user then clicks a button. The user will now receive a spirit animal name, fx Benjamin - The fullmoon wolf.

### Markup time!
Create an input element, a button and a tag to display the spirit animal into.

### Setting up the events
When the user clicks the button, get the name the user wrote in the input field. 

### Spirit animal part
Now we can get the users name, next step is to add the spirit animal string and display that the users name, a dash and then the spirit animal. Fx Name: Peter: Peter - The crying butterfly 
For creating the spirit animal create an array with 10 string representing spirit animals. Now get a random item in the array that will represent the spirit animal.

### New spirit animal
Now a user tells us that he wants a new spirit animal. No problem we say. Let's create functionality where a user can press a button and then get a new spirit animal.

### Event types - *Optional and a little tricky*
Give the user the possibility to select when the spirit animal should be created. Should it be when the user clicks the button or when the input changes or when text is written in the input field? What are the differences between these events? How can the user *select between options* in html? Maybe time for google!

## Feedback giving time!
Find a student to give feedback using this site: https://hyf-peer-review.herokuapp.com/
The feedback should be given after the homework has been handed in, preferably the latest two days after. 

To help you get started we have created some resources about giving feedback. Find them here: https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum/tree/master/review


## Hand in Homework:
Go over your homework one last time:

- Does every file run without errors and with the correct results?
- Have you used `const` and `let` and avoided `var`?
- Do the variable, function and argument names you created follow the [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md)?
- Is your code well-formatted (see [Code Formatting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md))?

If you can answer yes to the above questions then you are ready to hand if the homework:
* Find the hyf-homework git repo (forked from [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/hyf-homework))
* Add your homework files in the Javascript/javascript2/week1 folder
* To finish the homework, use the link in the top of your classes slack channel.
